  #Information about the current and historical prices for given shares.

  #Scenario: View a share price
  #A single number, being the IEX real time price, the 15 minute delayed market price, or the previous close price, is returned.
#
  #This scenario is for demonstration purposes.
  #For a real application, we would need to explore the behaviour of retreiveing the latest market price or the closed price depending on the time,
  #and be able to control or mock the market prices and status.

    #Given I am an active trader on IEX
    #When I request the latest price for AAPL
    #Then I should see the latest market price or the previous closed price
